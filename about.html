			<h2>Our Story</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="story-content">
			<div class="story-text">
				<p>Seatinez Tax Service was born from a simple belief: everyone deserves honest, personal tax help—not a corporate runaround.</p>
				
				<p>We started this business because we saw too many people in our community struggling with taxes. Big tax companies treated them like numbers. They felt confused, rushed, and worried about hidden fees.</p>
				
				<p>We decided to do things differently. We opened our doors in Chicago to serve our neighbors face-to-face. We take time to understand each client's situation. We explain everything in plain English (or Spanish). And we treat you like family—because that's how we'd want to be treated.</p>
				
				<p>Today, we're proud to be a trusted part of the Chicago community, helping families and businesses get their taxes done right, year after year.</p>

			<h2>Why We Started This Business</h2>
			<p>We saw our community needed something different. People were tired of being treated like numbers at big tax companies. They wanted someone who would listen, explain things clearly, and actually care about getting them the best result.</p>
